--How to Compile
In this directory, enter the following command:
$ make apsp
It will generate the executable file " apsp " in the current directory 
$ make sssp
It will generate the executable file " sssp " in the current directory 

If you want to generate all the executable files in the current directory, please enter the following command
$ make

If you want to remove these executable files, please enter the following command
$ make clean




--How to Run
Usage: srun -c 12 -n <procs> -N <procs> -pbatch ./<exe> <in> <out> 

The meanings of the arguments are:
procs – int; [1, 4]; number of processes.
in  – string; the path to the input file.
out – string; the path to the output file.

e.g.:
srun -c12 -n3 -N3 -pbatch ./apsp ./testcase/input/dense_5.in ./apsp/dense_5.out



--Verify
You can use different.cpp to generate an executable file such that you can use it to check the correctness of your output

To Compile: g++ -std=c++11 different.cpp -o different
To Run:     ./different <answer> <out>

            The meanings of the arguments are:
            answer - string; the path to the file with the correct answer.
            out –    string; the path to the file of your answer.
