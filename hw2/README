--How to Compile
In this directory, enter the following command:
$ make mpi_static
It will generate the executable file " mpi_static " in the current directory 
$ make mpi_dynamic
It will generate the executable file " mpi_dynamic " in the current directory 
$ make omp
It will generate the executable file " omp " in the current directory 
$ make hybrid
It will generate the executable file " hybrid " in the current directory 

If you want to remove these executable files please enter the following command
$ make clean

--How to Run
Usage: srun -n <procs> -c <thread> ./<exe> <thread> <left> <right> <lower> <upper> <w> <h> <out> 

The meanings of the arguments are:
procs – int; [1, 48]; number of processes. Always 1 for the OpenMP version.
thread – int; [1, 12]; number of threads per process. Always 1 for the MPI versions. (technically, this is the number of CPUs you can use per process; you are allowed to use more or fewer threads)
left – double; [-10, 10]; inclusive lower bound of the real axis.
right – double; [-10, 10]; non-inclusive upper bound of the real axis.
lower – double; [-10, 10]; inclusive lower bound of the imaginary axis.
upper – double; [-10, 10]; non-inclusive upper bound of the imaginary axis.
w – int; [1, 16000]; number of points in the x-axis for output.
h – int; [1, 16000]; number of points in the y-axis for output.
out – string; the path to the output file.


e.g.:
srun -n 4 -c 1 ./mpi_dynamic 1 -2 2 -2 2 400 400 out
